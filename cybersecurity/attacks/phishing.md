# Phishing
A type of attack using #social-engineering as well as spoofing in order to trick somebody into clicking a malicious link or giving up access credentials.
- URL and/or something in the email usually has something off

## Tricks and Misdirection:
- #typosquating:
	- A type of #URL-hijacking which attempts to copy a well known or trusted URL by creating one with a small typo
		- ex: `www.professormesser.com` vs `www.professormessor.com`
	- #prepending:
		- attempting to create a spoofed URL by *prepending* a letter to the beginning of a legitimate URL
		- ex: `pprofessormesser.com`
- #pretexting: lying to get information
	- the attacker pretends to be a character in a situation they create
	- ex: "Hi, we're calling from Visa regarding an automated payment to your account."
- #pharming:
	- harvesting large groups of victims
	- when an attacker redirects traffic to a legit site to a malicious/ bogus site
	- #DNS-poisoning
		- so when someone tries to visit the legitimate site, the Domain name server redirects them to the malicious site.

## Other Vectors:
All variations of a #scam
1. Vishing/ #vishing:
	- Voice phishing is a type of phishing done over the phone
	- caller ID spoofing
	- fake security checks/ bank updates, etc.
- SMishing/ #smishing:
	- done over text message
	- often include a link
	- spoofing

## Recon for a Phishing attack:
Gathering information on the victim.
- Background information
- social media (Facebook, Linkedin, etc.)
- Corporate/ company website
- More #OSINT done on a victim = better ability to create a believable pretext
	- #spearfishing:
		- when a phishing attack is highly targeted and crafted in a way to seem the most legitimate to the targeted individual.
		- May include info r/t:
			- workplace
			- family/ friends
			- recent financial transactions/ where you bank
	- #whaling:
		- a spearphishing attack directed at a CEO, CFO or other high value target
		- promises the possibility of a large catch/ gain for attacker
			- victim has more access to critical resources and credentials


## Emails:
[[email]] phishing is very common
