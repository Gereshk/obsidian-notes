# Repo Maintenance/ To-Do:
As I write and upload notes to GitHub, my process as it relates to Obsidian's formatting changes. So, I end up having to go back and fix notes I've uploaded in the past.

Additionally, as one's knowledge grows, they may need to go back and fix some mistakes in prior notes ;).
