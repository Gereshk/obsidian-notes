# Database Management Systems
Create, define, host, and manage databases.

## Essential Features:
#Concurrency:
> When multiple users are interacting with the DB simultaneously, #DBMS makes sure the concurrent interactions succeed and not cause data to be corrupted or lost.

#Consistency:
> W/ increased concurrent interactions, the data needs to remain consistent and valid throughout the database

#Security:
> Provides "fine-grained" user authentication and permissions to prevent unauthorized viewing or changing of data.
