# Structured Query Language
A language created to manipulate data in the Relational Database Management Systems ( #RDBMS)

## The language:
Consists of three parts:
1. a #data-definition-language 
	- handles the schema creation and modification
		- ex: ``CREATE TABLE`` creates a new table in the #database
		- ``ALTER TABLE`` changes the structure of an existing table
2. a #data-manipulation-language
	- provides the interface/constructs to query and update data
		- ex: ``SELECT``, ``INSERT``, ``UPDATE``, ``DELETE``, etc.
3. a #data-control-language
	- deals with user authentication/ authorization and security
		- ex: ``GRANT`` or ``REVOKE``

### SQL Standard:
- The first #SQL-standard was implemented in 1986 to standardize use among vendors
	- by the American Standards Institute ( #ANSI)
- Latest release standard = #SQL/2011
- Even though there are standards, #SQL-dialects have been created in their use spaces when consumers want features or capabilities which SQL doesn't yet have.
