# Open System Interconnection Model

A layered networking framework developed by the International Standards Organization ( #ISO) to conceptualize how communication and networking should be done between devices/ entities/ heterogenous systems.

## 7 Layers:
| 1. Physical Layer  | 2. Data Link Layer | 3. Network Layer | 4. Transport Layer | 5. Session Layer | 6. Presentation Layer | 7. Application Layer |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| The #physical-layer uses a physical medium to transmit individual bits from one node to another | The [[data-link-layer]] Transfers data #frames from one node to another connected by a physical layer/ medium | The [[network-layer]] delivers individual #pakets of data from one source to another using addressing and routing (non-physicla) | The #transport-layer is responsible for deliving the entire message from a source to the destination host | The #session-layer establishes ongoing sessions b/w two users and handles #synchronization, #dialog-control, and other services | The #presentation-layer monitors syntax/ semantics of transmitted data including translation, #compression, and #encryption | The #application-layer provides application program interface ([[API]]) to the user
