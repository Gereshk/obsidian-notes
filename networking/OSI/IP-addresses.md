==IP addresses can change from device to device but cannot be used simultaneously within the same network===
- can change for one device r/t whether it's on a public or private network (will determine whether they have  a public or private IP address)
- #public-IP addresses used to identify a device on the internet
	- any data sent to a device through it's public-facing IP address will be identified w/ its public IP
	- provided by an #ISP for a monthly fee
- #private-IP addresses used to identify a device w/i a public/ private network
	- two devices on the same network will use their private IP addresses to communicate

## #IPV4 & #IPV6:
==As more devices become connected, it's becoming harder to get a public IP address==
- Per Cisco, by 2021 there was ~ 50 billion connected devices.
- IPv4 uses a numbering system (2^32) which supplies 4.29 billion addresses
- IPv6 supports up to ==2^128 (340+ trillion)== IP addresses
	- and is also more efficient r/t new methodologies
