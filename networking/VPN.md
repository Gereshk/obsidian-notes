*connects a device from the outside to a private network*

TYPES:
- #remote-access:
	- Connecting a device to a LAN (local area network)
	- externally
- #site-to-site:
	- connecting two networks which are separate (goegraphically etc)
	- #extranet-based : 
		- two networks connect, which are not part of the same organization

Security:
- remote access is authenticated and uses encryption
	- confidentiality: VPN connections ensure that data even at packet level is encrypted (packet sniffing)
		- not all VPN protocols provide encryption
	- authentication: sender is authenticated
	- integrity: prevents tampering w/ transmitted data
